# ZoneFlow

ZoneFlow is a service designed to help students discover and access public study spaces in their city, both individually and as a group. Developed as a Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) course project by a team of seven, ZoneFlow aims to reduce overcrowding in libraries and study rooms by offering smart search, filtering, and scheduling features.

## Description

ZoneFlow provides a centralized library of public study places (e.g., libraries, study halls, coworking areas) where users can:

* Search for study spaces by name or location.
* Filter results based on capacity, opening hours, available amenities (Wi-Fi, power outlets, noise level, etc.).
* View live occupancy information (when available).
* Schedule group study sessions by sharing availability with teammates.
* Receive notifications about space availability and schedule updates.

Built with a responsive front-end prototype (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), ZoneFlow demonstrates a complete HCI design process: context analysis, need-finding interviews, personas, conceptual design, wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and iterative refinement.

## Features

* **Search Bar**: Quickly locate libraries and study rooms by name, location, or keyword.
* **Filter Panel**: Narrow down options based on criteria such as size, amenities, noise level, and opening hours.
* **Notifications**: An icon on the homepage indicates unread notifications; users can opt-in for alerts when preferred spaces become available or when group members confirm sessions.
* **Group Scheduling**: Team members can compare their availabilities and book an optimal time slot together.
* **Interactive Prototype**: Clickable mockups demonstrate the user flow from discovering a study space to final booking.

## Documentation

Each `C#` folder contains the deliverables corresponding to a stage of our HCI design process:

* **C1**: Context analysis, stakeholder interviews, and need-finding.
* **C2**: Personas, scenarios, and conceptual design.
* **C3**: Requirements specification and design guidelines.
* **C4**: Low- and high-fidelity prototypes, along with design rationale.
* **C5**: Heuristic evaluation report.
* **C6**: Usability testing results and iterative corrections.
* **C7**: Final course presentation.

To explore our process in detail, open the PDFs in each folder.
